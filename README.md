# Stable Diffusion

This project generates images using Stable Diffusion. The model applies various artistic effects to images, such as edge enhancement, tilt-shift blur, deep focus, and vignette effects.

## Features

- **Edge Enhancement**: Uses Sobel and Laplacian filters to enhance edges.
- **Tilt-Shift Blur**: Applies a Gaussian blur for a cinematic effect.
- **Deep Focus**: Sharpens the center while blurring the sides.
- **Vignette Effect**: Adds an artistic vignette to the images.

## Artistic Enhancement Loss

The `artistic_enhancement_loss` function is used to apply creative transformations to the images. It includes:
- Edge detection using Sobel and Laplacian filters.
- Tilt-shift blur for a cinematic effect.
- Deep focus to sharpen the center and blur the sides.
- Vignette effect for an artistic look.

## File Structure

- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the necessary Python packages.
- `generated images/`: Contains example images generated by the model.
- `assignment17.ipynb`: The original notebook containing the code.
- `app.py`: The main application file for deployment on Hugging Face Spaces.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.


## Deployment

The model is deployed on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Rakavi12/Stable-Diffusion). 
Please note that since it is running on a free CPU, it might take longer to process images.
